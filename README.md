## Emotes

This is a Minecraft Spigot Plugin wich replaces chat messages with your own Twitch Emotes. Its simple to configure and expandable. 

Any Emote in Chat will be replaced with unused PUA characters and your Server Texturepack will replace them with your emote you added in the pack!
## Tutorial
1. add the emote to config.yml with the unused PUA character you want to use
   
    here is a list of all PUA characters: https://symbl.cc/en/unicode/blocks/private-use-area/
